We perform a wide range of preprocessing tasks such as converting date columns to datetime objects, encoding categorical features, merging data from different datasets, handling missing values, and generating new features.\n","\n","**Model Building & Evaluation**: Here, we train four different models: XGBoost, ARIMA, LSTM, and Prophet.
